# Auto Like Tag Instagram

I was looking for a script to do the instagram autofollow, but I didn't find anything working, I decided to create one.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need to install the script on Instagram, after searching for the tag.

```

### Installing

1) Open the auto-like.js script, copy the content and paste it into the Google Chrome developer console.

2) Press enter to install the script.

3) To start the script paste these two lines of code into the console and press enter.


```
var myAutoLike = new AutoLike("javascript", 100);
myAutoLike.start();
```
